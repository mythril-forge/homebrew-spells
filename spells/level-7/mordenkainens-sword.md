## Description
You create a *small*, sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range.
The sword lasts for the duration, or until you cast this spell again.
You can dispel the sword at any moment (no action required).

When you cast the spell, and then later as a bonus action, you can move the sword up to 40 feet and make a Melee Spell Attack against a creature or object within 5 feet of it.
On a hit, the target takes `3d10` force damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d10` for every slot level above 7th.
