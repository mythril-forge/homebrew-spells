## Description
Thin and wispy tendrils of elemental substance wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

The barrier provides you with resistance from cold, fire, or lightning (your choice).

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a Melee Attack, the shield erupts with elemental force.
The attacker takes `2d8` damage from the type you chose.
