## Description
A 30-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line of roaring flame blasts from your outstreched hand in a direction you choose.
Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `4d8` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Objects within the spell's area that aren't being worn or carried also take this damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 2nd.
