## Description
One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **charmed** by you for the duration.
While the target is **charmed** in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.

The **charmed** target must use its movement before acting on each of its turns to move towards a creature that you mentally choose.
If the **charmed** target can not end its movement within 5 feet of the chosen creature, it uses the *dash* action to close the distance.

Once within 5 feet of the chosen creature, the **charmed** creature must target it with its most effective Melee Attacks (at the DM's discretion) until it is killed.
If it does so and the **charmed** target has any remaining attacks or movement, you must mentally choose what its next target creature is.
It tries to move towards that creature and attack it in a similar fashion.

If you do not command the creature to move or attack when it can still do so, the spell ends.
On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends.
Also, the target can make a Wisdom Saving Throw at the end of each of its turns.
On a success, the spell ends.
