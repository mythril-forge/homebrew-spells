## Description
You cause a creature or an object that you touch to grow larger for the duration.
Choose either a creature or an object.
If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, it gains the following effects:
- The target's size category increases by one
- The target's mass & weight multiply to match its new size
- The target's movement speed increases by 10 feet
- The target has advantage on all strength-based Ability Checks and Saving Throws
- The target has disadvantage on all dexterity-based Ability Checks and Saving Throws
- The target can effectively carry and use oversized weapons and equipment
- The target's hit point maximum increase by `1d8` for the duration, and also regains hit points equal to this amount

This spell only affects one target object or creature.
If the target is fitted with cloth, armor, or other equipment that becomes too small for the target's new form, it either breaks or snaps off, falling to the ground in the creature's original space.

If there isn't enough room for the target to increase its size when this spell takes effect, it either breaks the environment around it, breaks itself, or becomes **restrained**.

> This spell can be also be used to allow a target creature to wield large weapons easily.
> A *large* humanoid can use a greatsword like a shortsword and a longsword like a dagger.
> They can use even unwieldly direspears, direswords and giantaxes, which deal `2d6`, `3d6` and `2d12` damage respectively.
> Generally, large variants of weapons deal one damage dice more than normal.
