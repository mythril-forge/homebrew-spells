## Description
A 5-foot diameter sphere of elemental force whirls into existance in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration.
The sphere creates heavy winds (60 miles per hour) within 5 feet of it and heavily obscures the area.

Any creature that moves through the dust devil or ends its turn within 5 feet of it must make a Strength Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes `1d6` bludgeoning damage, and if the creature is *large* or smaller, it is pushed 10 feet away from the dust devil in a direction of your choice and it falls **prone**.
On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed or knocked **prone**.

As a bonus action, you can move the dust devil up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward and downward.
If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature must make the Saving Throw against the sphere's damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 2nd.
