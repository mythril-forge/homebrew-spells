## Description
Your gesture forces one humanoid you can see within range to make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the target cannot take reactions until the end of your next turn, and must move up to its speed in a direction you choose.
In addition, you can cause the target to drop whatever it is holding.
This spell has no effect on a humanoid that is immune to being **charmed**.
