## Description
Choose an area of nonmagical flame that you can see.
The fire is extinguished unless it is particularly large, and you create one of the below effects.

### Black Powder
The target transforms into 4 ounces of *black powder*.

### Fireworks
The target suddenly explodes with a dazzling display of patterns and colors.
Each creature within 20 feet of the target must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or take `3d4` fire damage and become **blinded** and **deafened** until the end of your next turn.
On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't **blinded** or **deafened**.

### Smoke
Thick black smoke spreads out from the target in a 20-foot radius, moving around corners.
The area of the smoke is heavily obscured.
Creatures who move through the smokes area or end their turn there must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, they go into a coughing fit, and are **poisoned** until they exit the cloud.
The smoke persists for 5 minutes or until a strong wind disperses it.
