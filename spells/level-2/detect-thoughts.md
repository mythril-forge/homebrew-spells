## Description
For the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures.
When you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the spell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you.
Your focus on a target ends once it is either out of sight or out of range.
If the creature you choose has an Intelligence of 3 or lower or doesn't speak any language, the creature is unaffected.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature&mdash;what is most on its mind in that moment.
As an action, you can either shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, or attempt to lock onto a creature to probe deeper into its mind.
If you choose to probe deeper, you can no longer shift your attention to another creature for the duration of this spell.

When you probe a creature’s deep thoughts, it must make a Intelligence Saving Throw.
If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, its relevant knowledge, and anything that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates).
If it succeeds, the spell ends Either way, the target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you shift your attention to another creature's thoughts, the creature can use its action on its turn to make another Intelligence Saving Throw; if it succeeds, the spell ends.

Questions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape the course of both its surface and deep thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation.

You can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking creatures you can't see.
When you cast the spell or as your action during the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of you.
The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.
You can't detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or one that doesn't speak any language.

Once you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read its thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even if you can't see it, but it must still be within range.
