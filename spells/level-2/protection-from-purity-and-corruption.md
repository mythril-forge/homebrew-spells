## Description
You ward one object or willing creature within range against extraplanar entities.
For the duration, the target has resistance to either radiant or necrotic damage (your choice).
Until the spell ends, the target is also protected against one type of creature of your choice from the following: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead.
When this spell's recipient is targeted by an attack, spell, or ability, they can choose to flip `a coin` if the source of the effect is a creature of the chosen type.
On a `heads`, they are not affected by the action.

If the target is a creature, they can't be **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by a creature of the chosen type.
If the target is already **charmed**, **frightened**, or possessed by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new Saving Throw against the relevant effect.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 1st.
