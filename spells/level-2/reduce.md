## Description
You cause a creature or an object that you touch to shrink for the duration.
Choose either a creature or an object.
If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a success, the spell has no effect.

If the target is a creature, it gains the following effects:
- The target's size category decreases by one
- The target's mass & weight multiply to match its new size
- The target's movement speed decreases by 10 feet
- The target has advantage on all dexterity-based Ability Checks and Saving Throws
- The target has disadvantage on all strength-based Ability Checks and Saving Throws
- The target cannot effectively carry or use what would be normal-sized weapons and equipment for it
- The target's target's hit point maximum decreases by `1d8` for the duration

This spell only affects one target object or creature.
If the target is fitted with cloth, armor, or other equipment that becomes too large for the target's new form, it harmlessly drops to the ground in the target's original space.

If there isn't enough room for the target to increase its size when this spell ends, it either breaks the environment around it, breaks itself, or becomes **restrained** until the spell ends.

> This spell can be also be used to disable a target creature.
> A *small* creature can't wield heavy weapons effectively and must wield versatile weapons with two hands.
> A *tiny* creature has trouble with all but light weapons.
