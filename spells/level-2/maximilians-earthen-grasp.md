## Description
Choose an object or creature that you can see within range that is *large* or smaller.
A *medium* hand made from compacted soil rises there and reaches for that creature.
If the target is a creature, it must make a Strength Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the target takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage and is **restrained** for the spell's duration.
On a success, the creature takes half damage and isn't **restrained**.

As an action, you can cause the hand to crush the **restrained** target, which must make a Strength Saving Throw.
The target takes `2d6` bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the **restrained** target can use its action to make a Strength Ability Check against your Spell Save DC.
On a success, the target escapes and is no longer **restrained** by the hand.

As an action, you can cause the hand to reach for a different target within range.
The hand releases a **restrained** target if you do either.
