## Description
Describe or name a specific kind of beast or plant.
Concentrating on the voice of nature in your surroundings, you sense the direction and distance to the nearest creature or plant of that kind, as long as it is within a mile of you.
If such a beast or plant is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific beast or plant known to you, as long as you have seen it up close&mdash;within 30 feet&mdash;at least once.
Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest plant or animal of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of fish, mammal, tree, or herb.

This spell can't locate anything if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.
