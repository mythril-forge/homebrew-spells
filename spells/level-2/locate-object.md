## Description
Describe or name an object that is familiar to you.
You sense the direction to the object's location, as long as that object is within a mile of you.
If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement.

The spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it up close&mdash;within 30 feet&mdash;at least once.
Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon.

This spell can't locate anything if any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and the object.
