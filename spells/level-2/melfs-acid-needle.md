## Description
A shimmering green needle streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. 
On a hit, the target takes `3d4` extra acid damage.
Hit or miss, each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the attack's point of impact must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `3d4` acid damage.
If the attack hits your initial target, then it automatically fails its save.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by `1d4` for each slot level above 2nd.
