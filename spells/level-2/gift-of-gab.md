## Description
> When I met Jim Darkmagic, I wondered how he got anything done in that outfit.
> I have since learned that most of his talents involve standing and talking.
> His outfit is perfect for that.

Jim Darkmagic is said to have invented this spell, originally calling it *I said what?!* Have you ever been talking to the local monarch and accidentally mentioned how their son looks like your favorite hog from when you were growing up on the family farm? We've all been there! But rather than being beheaded for an honest slip of the tongue, you can pretend it never happened&mdash;by ensuring that no one knows it happened.

When you cast this spell, you skillfully reshape the memories of listeners in your immediate area, so that each creature of your choice that you can see forgets everything you said within the last 10 seconds.
Those creatures then remember that you actually said the words you speak as the verbal component of the spell.
