## Description
You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range.
Until the spell ends, you deal an extra `1d4` necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack.
Also, the target gains one semi-permanent level of **exhaustion** that is removed only when the spell ends.

If the target dies before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to curse a new creature within range.
If you do not do so within 5 minutes of the target's death, the spell ends early.

The spell can also be ended early if you dismiss it (no action required) or if a [*remove curse*](../level-3/remove-curse.md) or [*dispel magic*](../level-3/dispel-magic.md) spell successfully ends its effect.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a higher level spell slot, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for much longer, as shown on the Enhanced Spell Duration table below.
