## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It sprouts enchanted stems and leaves that last until the end of your next turn.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you make an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it launches a salvo of thorny spikes toward your target, and the spell ends.
Hit or miss, each creature within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on the attack's intended point of impact must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `3d4` piercing damage.
On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.

## At Higher Levels
If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by `2d4` for each slot level above 1st.
