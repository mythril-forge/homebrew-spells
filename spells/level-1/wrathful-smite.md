## Description
When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and hit your target, your weapon becomes a conduit for thought-altering energies, and the attack deals an extra `1d12` psychic damage to the target as it rends the mind, then the spell ends. Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must make a Wisdom saving throw or be **frightened** of you. As an action, the creature can repeat this Wisdom saving throw to end the condition, steeling its resolve against you.

When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a ranged weapon attack, in which case the spell ends. Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).
