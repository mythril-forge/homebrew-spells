## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It becomes a conduit for dark, thought-influencing energies.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it extends its insane influence upon your target, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `1d12` psychic damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The target must then succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or become **frightened** of you.

As an action, a **frightened** creature can make a Wisdom Saving Throw to overcome the fear, steeling its resolve against you, and ending the effect on itself on a success.
Otherwise, if a **frightened** creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, the creature can make this Wisdom Saving Throw without using an action.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
