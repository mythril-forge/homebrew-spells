## Description
You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range.
Make a Ranged Spell Attack against the target.
On a hit, the target takes `3d6` damage.
Choose one of the `d6`s.
The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown on the Elemental Choices table below.

#### Elemental Choices
| `d6` | Damage Type |
|------|-------------|
| 1    | Force       |
| 2    | Acid        |
| 3    | Thunder     |
| 4    | Fire        |
| 5    | Cold        |
| 6    | Lightning   |

If you roll two of the same numbers on any pair of `d6`s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it.
Make a new Attack & Damage Roll against the new target, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.
A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.
