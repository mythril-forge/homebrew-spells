A falling creature's rate of descent slows to 30 feet per round until the spell ends.
If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the magic ends for that creature.
The spell ends when there are no more creatures affected by its magic.
You can dismiss the magic on any number of creatures at any time (no action required).
