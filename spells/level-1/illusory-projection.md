## Description
You create a convincingly realistic image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot-long cube.
The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration.
You have full control over the image's animation within its space.
The image is purely visual; it isn't accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects.

You can cause the image to move to any spot within range at any time (no action required).
As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image.
For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking.
You can also adjust the percieved physics of the image, such as how wind, light, and gravity interacts with it.
Detailed arrangements&mdash;like flowing cloaks, water, and hair&mdash;are intuitively taken care of through your magic.

If the illusion is of a moving creature or object, it has an AC of `9 + your Spellcasting Ability Modifier`.
Attacks and other forms of sudden physical collision with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it.
A creature that uses its action to explicitly examine or interact with the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence Saving Throw.
If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

> Tip: a player always knows somethings up if they are asked make a saving throw.
> Especially if it is a weird one, like Intelligence.
> In these cases, players can guess that they are making a check for an illusion&mdash;whether or not they pass.
> That means the cat is out of the bag for an illusion.
> The jig is up!
> 
> Half the fun in illusions is that the players don't know when an illusion exists.
> So, try to frame it a bit differently for illusions.
> Ask for an intelligence check, but give them proficiency if you know they are proficient in intelligence saving throws.
> If you aren't sure which players have this proficiency without asking, check their class.
> Classes with proficiency in Intelligence Saving Throws include:
> - Artificers
> - Druids
> - Mystics
> - Rogues
> - Wizards
