**Shape:** special

**Tags:** verbal, somatic, material

**Material Components:** 50 feet of rope worth atleast 1 sp, which the spell consumes

## Description
As you cast this spell, you use the rope to create a circle on the ground or the floor.
When you finish casting, the rope disappears and the circle becomes a magic trap.

Choose the size of the trap: *small*, *medium*, *large*, or *huge*.
The rope magically transforms to match the respectively chosen size.
This trap is nearly invisible, requiring a successful Wisdom Ability Check against your Spell Save DC to be discerned.

The trap triggers when a creature of the same size as the trap moves onto the ground or floor in the spell's radius.
The trap also triggers for creatures that are one size larger or smaller than the trap.
That creature must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or be magically hoisted into the air, leaving it hanging upside down several feet above the ground or the floor.
The target is then **restrained** there indefinately.
Once per day, the target can use an action to make a Dexterity Saving Throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Alternatively, someone else outside the trap who can reach the target can use an action to help them get out of the trap.
They must make a Dexterity Ability Check against your Spell Save DC to undo the magical ropes.
On a successful check, the **restrained** effect ends on the target.
