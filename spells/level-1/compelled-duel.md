## Description
You attempt to compel a creature into a duel with you.
One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, you and your declared rival are drawn to one another, compelled by your divine demand.
For the duration, the two of you have disadvantage on Attack Rolls against other creatures than one another.

If either of you attempt to move to a space that is further away from the other affected target, they must make a Wisdom Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the affected creature's movement is canceled and restricted&mdash;it can only move towards their rival until the start of their next turn.
On a successful save, this spell does not restrict the creature's movement for that turn.

As an action, an affected creature can make a Wisdom Ability Check against your Spell Save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.
An affected creature can also use their reaction to end the spell if they are attacked by another creature other than thier rival.
In addition, the spell ends if the target creature ever exceeds the spell's range from you.

This spell's casting fails if it is cast by or on a creature who is already affected by another casting of this spell.
