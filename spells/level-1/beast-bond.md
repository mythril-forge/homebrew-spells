## Description
This spell lets you establish a blood bond with a friendly beast&mdash;creating a telepathic link, and encouraging it to aid in your endeavors.
Choose a friendly beast that you can hold or touch.
The target must be able to see and hear you, and must be aware of you.
It must make a Wisdom Saving Throw, and does so with disadvantage if it is **charmed** by you or your companions.
A creature with an Intelligence Score of `4` or higher automatically succeeds on its save.
On a failed save, the beast is **charmed** by you for the spell's duration.
If you or one of your companions harm the target, the charm on them ends.

While a creature is **charmed** by you in this way, you form a telepathic link with it while you are within 120 feet of one another.
Through the link, the beast can understand your telepathic messages to it, and it can telepathically communicate simple emotions and concepts back to you.
Once per round, you can use your action to issue commands to the beast through the link, and it obeys as best as it can.
Otherwise, your beast acts on its own, focusing on protecting itself and you.
The beast rolls its own initiative, however it can choose to take its turn directly after you on your initiative count.
