## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
You channel raw arcane energy into the weapon.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
Until the spell ends, Weapon Attacks made using this weapon deal an extra `1d6` force damage on a hit.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
