## Description
Grasping weeds and vines sprout from solid ground in a 30-foot-long cube originating from a point within range.
The vines reach out up to 5 feet from the ground.
For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When you cast the spell, and then later as an action, you can command the plants to grasp and pull at creatures in their area.
Each creature must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or be **restrained** by the entangling plants for the duration.

A creature **restrained** by the plants can use its action to repeat the Strength Saving Throw.
On a successful save, it frees itself.

When the spell ends, the conjured plants retract into the earth and root themselves there as ordinary foliage.
