## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It begins to glow with a righteous gleam, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it expels its power, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `2d8` radiant damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The extra damage increases by `1d8` if the target is an undead or fiend.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the attack increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 1st.
