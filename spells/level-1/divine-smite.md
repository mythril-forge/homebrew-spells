## Description
When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and hit your target, your weapon discharges a righteous light that is clearly visible within 300 feet of it, and the attack deals an extra `2d8` radiant damage to the target, then the spell ends.
The extra damage increases by `1d8` if the target is an undead or fiend.

When you make a weapon attack during this spell's duration and miss your target, nothing happens unless it was a ranged weapon attack, in which case the spell ends.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again (no action required).

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the extra damage dealt by the attack increases by `1d8` for each slot level above 1st.
