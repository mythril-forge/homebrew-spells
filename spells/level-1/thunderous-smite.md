## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It begins to hum and vibrate rhythmically.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it releases a thunderous boom that is clearly audible within a mile of your target, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `4d4` thunder damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
If the target is *large* or smaller, then it must also succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
