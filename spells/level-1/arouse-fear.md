## Description
This spell lets you awaken a dark horror slumbering deep within an enemy's mind.
Choose a creature that you can see within range.
It must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become **frightened** of you for the spell's duration.
A construct or an undead automatically succeeds on its save.

A creature **frightened** in this way can use its action to repeat the Wisdom saving throw.
If such a **frightened** creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn't have line of sight to you, then it can repeat the Wisdom saving throw.
Either way, the fear ends for that creature on a successful save.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
