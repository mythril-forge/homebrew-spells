## Description
You accelerate an item, which then flings at your whim.
Choose one *medium* or smaller object that you can see within range and that isn't being worn or carried by another creature.
The object must weigh less than 5 pounds.
When you cast this spell, you can choose to either trivialize the object's movement, or weaponize it.

### Trivialize Movement
The object moves up to 60 feet in a straight line in a direction of your choice before striking the ground.
The object's movement can pass through a creature's space.
A creature at the end of the object's path can use their reaction to catch the object.
Any other creature within the object's movement path can also use their reaction to catch the object, although they must make a successful Dexterity Ability Check to do so.

If the movement would cause the object to strike another object, the object and whatever it strikes each take `1d8` bludgeoning damage.
If the object strikes anything, its movement ends early.

### Weaponize Movement
The object flies in 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line in a direction of your choice before striking the ground.

If the object would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the object strikes the target.
Otherwise, the object continues on its original trajectory.

When the object strikes a creature or another object, the object and whatever it strikes each take `3d8` bludgeoning damage.
If the object strikes anything, its movement ends early.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the maximum weight of objects that you can target with this spell increases by 5 pounds, and the damage increases by `1d8`, for each slot level above 1st.
