## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
As you hold the weapon above you, it absorbs a massive volume of air.
Weird afterimages of the item trail in its wake until the end of your next turn.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you make an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, duplicates of yourself deliver simultaneous strikes across multiple fabricated demi-timelines, and the spell ends.
You have advantage on this Attack Roll.
If the attack hits, it deals an extra `3d10` force damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.

Once you make this first attack, you can make up to four additional attacks with this same weapon before the end of your turn, which each get the benefits from this spell.
Each attack can be against the same target or different ones.

In addition, when you first cast this spell, time folds and space bends around you.
You gain the benefits of taking the *dash* and *disengage* actions.
Until the end of your turn, you can also teleport at will up to your remaining movement to an unoccupied space that you can see.
You must count the distances that you teleport as a part of your movement.
