## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It begins to crackle with interplanar magic.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you hit with a Weapon Attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it creates a volatile, interplanar portal that fills the target's space for a split second, and the spell ends.
The attack deals an extra `1d60` force damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.
The target must then succeed on a Charisma Saving Throw or be banished.
It has disadvantage on this Saving Throw if this attack reduces the target to 60 hit points or less.

A banished target vanishes, teleporting to another plane of existence.
If the target is native to a different plane than the one you're on, they return to their home plane.
Otherwise, the target randomly teleports to a different plane of existence.
In either case, the target arrives at a location in the plane that is safe enough for them to survive easily.

If you let go of the weapon, its magic dissipates, and the spell ends.
It also ends if you make a Ranged Attack with the weapon and miss.
Whenever this spell ends, you can immediately cast it again using the same weapon (no action required).
