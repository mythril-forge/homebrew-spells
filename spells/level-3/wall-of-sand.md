## Description
You create a wall of swirling sand on the ground at a point you can see within range.
You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 10 feet thick, or you can make a ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 10 feet thick.
The wall vanishes when the spell ends.
It blocks line of sight and stops most spells and attacks in its tracks, but does not deny movement.
A creature is **blinded** and **suffocated** while in the wall's space, and must spend 5 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves there.

Until the spell ends, you can command the sand to compress onto a creature you know to be within the wall.
That creature must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, the creature takes `4d6` bludgeoning damage, and takes half damage on a successful one.
