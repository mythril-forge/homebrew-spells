You address allies, staff, or innocent bystanders to exhort and inspire them to greatness, whether they have anything to get excited about or not.
Choose up to six creatures within range that can hear you.
For the duration, each affected creature gains `2d4` temporary hit points and has advantage on Charisma and Wisdom Saving Throws.
If an affected creature is hit by an attack, it has advantage on the next Attack Roll it makes.
Once an affected creature loses the temporary hit points granted by this spell, the spell ends for that creature.
