## Description
You fire a shot.
Make three attacks within the area.
Then do the other stuff.

You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear. 

First, you can make three identical Weapon Attacks against three targets of your choice within a 60-foot cone, using the single weapon or piece of ammunition as required by the spell.
You don't need to provide any further weapons to be thrown or ammo to be fired.

Next, each creature in the spell's area must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d8` damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.
