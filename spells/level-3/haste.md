## Description
You alter time around up to two willing creatures of your choice in a 10-foot-long cube within range.
While affected by this spell, a creature gains several benefits:
- Their movement speed is doubled.
- Their attacks have advantage.
- They get a `+2` bonus to AC and Dexterity Saving Throws.
- They have advantage on Strength and Dexterity Saving Throws.
- They have an additional bonus action.
- They have an additional reaction.
- If they can use their action to take the *attack* action, then they can make one additional attack as a part of that action.
- If they use their action to take the *cast a spell* action, then they can flip `a coin`.
	On a `heads`, they can immediately recast the same spell as a part of that action.

When the spell ends, an affected creature becomes **stunned** until the end of its next turn, as a wave of lethargy sweeps over it.
