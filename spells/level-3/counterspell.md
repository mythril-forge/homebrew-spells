## Description
You attempt to interrupt a target in the process of casting a spell.
If the target is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect.
Otherwise, you must succeed on an Intelligence Saving Throw against the target's Spell Save DC plus the interrupted spell's level.
You have a bonus on this Saving Throw equal to this spell's level (normally three).
On a success, the interrupted spell fails and has no effect.
If you fail this save by 10 or more, you take `3d10` force damage as the magic whiplashes back at you.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can counter magic with no Saving Throw if the interrupted spell's level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
Otherwise, your bonus to the Intelligence Saving Throw increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.
