## Description
Choose a point you can see on the ground within range.
A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you can see on the ground within range, which blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame.
Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A target takes `8d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Objects within the spell's area that aren't being worn or carried also take this damage.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by `1d6` for each slot level above 3rd.
