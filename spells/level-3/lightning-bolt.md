A stroke of lightning forming a 120-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line arcs from your outstreched arm in a direction you choose.
Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `8d6` lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
Objects within the spell's area that aren't being worn or carried also take this damage.

## At Higher Levels
