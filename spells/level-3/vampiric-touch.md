## Description
The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds.
When you cast this spell, and then later as a bonus action, you can make a Melee Spell Attack against a creature you can reach.
On a hit, the target takes `2d10` necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the damage that you dealt.
