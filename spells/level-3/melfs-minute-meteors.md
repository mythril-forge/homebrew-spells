## Description
You create six *tiny* meteors in your space.
They float in the air and orbit you for the spell's duration.
When you cast the spell&mdash;and as a bonus action thereafter&mdash;you can expend one the meteors, sending them streaking toward a point or points you choose within 120 feet of you.
Once a meteor reaches its destination or impacts against a solid surface, the meteor explodes.
Each creature within 5 feet of the point where the meteor explodes must make a Dexterity Saving Throw.
A creature takes `3d6` fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of meteors created increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.
