## Description
Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range.
Then, choose one spell that you know is affecting the target.
If the disrupted spell is of 3rd level or lower, you neutralize the magic and the spell ends.
Otherwise, you must succeed on an Intelligence Saving Throw against the disrupted spell's Spell Save DC (determined by its original spellcaster) plus its level.
You have a bonus on this Saving Throw equal to this spell's level (normally three).
On a success, you neutralize the magic and the disrupted spell ends.
If you fail this save by 10 or more, you take `3d10` force damage as the magic whiplashes back at you.

If the target is a magic item, its magic remains, but the spell breaks its owner's attunement to the object so it can't be used until it is attuned to once again.
In this case, the DM adjucates the approximate spell level used to enchant the item.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can neutralize magic with no Saving Throw if the disrupted spell's level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used.
Otherwise, your bonus to the Intelligence Saving Throw increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.
