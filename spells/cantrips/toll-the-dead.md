## Description
You point at one creature you can see within range.
The sound of a dolorous bell fills the air around it, which can be heard up to a mile away.
The target must succeed on a Wisdom Saving Throw or take this spell's necrotic damage, sloughing off shreds of its spirit.

When this spell is first cast, it deals `1d4` necrotic damage.
Each time this spell is cast within a mile of you before the end of the next round, the damage that this spell inflicts increases to the next tier of damage, as shown in the Damage Tiers table below.
This affects any and all future castings of this spell in the area.

#### Damage Tiers
| # Castings | Damage Dice |
|------------|-------------|
| 1          | `1d4`       |
| 2          | `1d6`       |
| 3          | `1d8`       |
| 4          | `1d10`      |
| 5          | `1d12`      |
| 6          | `1d16`      |
| 7+         | `1d20`      |

If this spell is not cast again within a mile of you before the end of the next round, the spell's damage resets to the first tier.
