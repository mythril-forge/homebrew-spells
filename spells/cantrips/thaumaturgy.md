## Description
You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range.
You create one of the following magical effects within range:
- The appearance of your eyes is strangely altered.
- Your voice temporarily booms up to three times as loud as normal.
- You affect small objects around you, causing unlocked containers, doors, and windows to fly open and slam shut.
	Unsecured items near you might fling around aimlessly.
- You call upon a force, and supernatural forces reciprocate—producing rumbles of thunder, cries of a raven, ominous whispers, light footsteps, and more.
- You cause strange, minor anomolies in the laws of physics.
	You briefly affect gravity, time, space, and other phenomena.
- You cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color.
- You have a subdued power over the elements.
	For example, you can conjure a tuft of flame, cause harmless tremors in the ground, or attain a freezing touch.

These effects are normally quite brief, but can last longer (at the DM's discretion) depending on the nature of the spell's specific casting.

> *Thaumaturgy* is a powerful roleplaying tool in that the spell's scope is not very limited by its description.
> The spell creates only modest effects, but the breadth of this minor power is bounded only by your imagination.
