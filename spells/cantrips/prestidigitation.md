## Description
This spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for practice.
You create one of the following magical effects within range:
- You create a miniature sensory effect, such as a shower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd odor.
- You chill, heat, soil, clean, color, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of material.
- You materialize a *small* mark or symbol onto an object or a surface.
- You transform the shape of one *tiny*, simple, nonmagical trinket into another.
- You have a subdued power over the elements.
	For example, you can instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a small campfire.
- You magically open or close an unlocked door or container within range.

These effects are normally quite brief, but can last longer (at the DM's discretion) depending on the nature of the spell's specific casting.

> *Prestidigitation* is a powerful roleplaying tool in that the spell's scope is not very limited by its description.
> The spell creates only modest effects, but the breadth of this minor power is bounded only by your imagination.
