## Description
You channel primal magic to cause your teeth or fingernails to sharpen.
Your unarmed strikes are primed for a series of feral attacks—tooth and claw:
- You become proficient with unarmed strikes while this spell is active.
- Your unarmed strikes have a non-magical bonus to Attack & Damage Rolls equal to half your Spellcasting Ability Modifier (rounded down).
- Your unarmed strikes deal `1d4` damage, unless they already do more.
- Your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing damage (your choice).

This spell immediately ends if it is cast again before its duration expires, or if you dismiss it (no action required).
