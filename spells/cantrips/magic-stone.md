## Description
You touch three stones and imbue them with magic, which lasts for the duration.
You or someone else can take a stone and use it in a Weapon Attack.
A stone can be used as an improvised weapon.
It can also be used as ammunition, and can be used normally with a sling or a similar weapon that hurls stones.
In either case, a stone has the following properties:
- A stone is considered magical.
- A stone has a magical bonus to Attack & Damage Rolls equal to half your Spellcasting Ability Modifier (rounded down).

The magic on a stone dissipates after it is used in an attack.
You can dismiss the magic on any number of stones at any time (no action required).
This spell immediately ends if it is cast again before its duration expires, or if there are no more stones affected by its magic.
The stones lose this magic once the spell ends.
