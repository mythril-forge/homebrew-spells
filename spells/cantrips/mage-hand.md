## Description
A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose within range.
The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it (no action required).
The hand vanishes if it exceeds the spell's range from you or if you cast this spell again.

When you cast the spell, and then later as an action, you can control the hand.
You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial.
You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

The hand can't attack, cast spells, activate magic items, or carry more than 10 pounds.
It also cannot handle complex tasks that would require an Ability Check.
