## Description
Choose a weapon that you are holding.
It is shrouded in green, flaming energy until the end of your next turn.
The weapon is considered magical for the duration (if it isn't already).
The first time you make an attack using this weapon before the spell ends, it unleashes its burning energy upon your target, and the spell ends.
If the attack hits, it deals an extra `2d4` fire damage in addition to the weapon's normal damage and effects.

If you roll the same numbers on both `d4`s, the flaming energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 5 feet of it.
Make a new Melee Weapon Attack against the new target, and make a new Damage Roll, which could cause the flaming energy to leap again.
The weapon's normal damage and effects only apply to the first target.
A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

If you let go of the weapon, its charm dissipates, and the spell ends.
