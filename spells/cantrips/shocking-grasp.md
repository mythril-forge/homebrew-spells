## Description
Lightning arcs and springs from your hand.
Make a Melee Spell Attack against a creature you can reach.
You have advantage on the Attack Roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal, or is itself made of metal.
On a hit, the target takes `1d12` lightning damage as its body reels and writhes from the painful shocks.
The target's contortions continue until the end of your next turn.
Until then, the target can't take reactions.

If the target that you hit is *large* or smaller, then it also has disadvantage on all Ability Checks until the end of your next turn.
A creature who is resistant to lightning damage ignores secondary effects caused by this spell.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by `1d12` for each slot level.
