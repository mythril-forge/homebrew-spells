## Description
You touch one *large* or smaller object.
Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius.
The light can be colored as you like.
Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light.
The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it (no action required).

If you target an object held or worn by a creature, that creature can make a Dexterity Saving Throw to avoid the spell.
