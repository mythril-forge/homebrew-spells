## Description
The presence of strong evil registers on your senses like a noxious odor, and powerful good rings like heavenly music in your ears.
When you cast this spell, you open your awareness to detect such forces.
Until the end of your next turn, you sense the presence of any celestial, fey, fiend, or undead within 120 feet of you, but not their direction, identity, or location.
Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the [*hallow*][hallow] spell.

The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 3 feet of wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or magical silence.
