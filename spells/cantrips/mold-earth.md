## Description
You knead a mass of dirt or stone, which must fit within a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point on the ground that you can see within range.
You can sculpt the earth to create one of the following effects:
- You focus this spell on a creature within 5 feet of the spell's area, blasting chunks of dirt and stone at the target.
	The target must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or take `1d6` bludgeoning damage.
	The ground in the area then becomes difficult terrain.
- You focus this spell on a creature within 5 feet of the spell's area, attempting to trip them with hooking bumps and debris.
	The target must succeed on a Dexterity Saving Throw or fall **prone**.
	The target must be *medium* or smaller, otherwise it automatically succeeds on this Saving Throw.
	The ground in the area then becomes difficult terrain.
- You roughen, loosen, and shape the ground in the area to become difficult terrain.
- You smooth, solidify, and shape the ground in the area to become fair terrain.
- If you target an area of loose earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away.
- You cause shapes and colors to appear on surfaces—spelling out words, creating images, or shaping patterns.
