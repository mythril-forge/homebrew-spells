## Description
You create a sloshing, 4-inch-diameter bubble of acid in your hand.
When you cast this spell, you can choose to immediately hurl the acid, or to store it for later use.

### Hurl Acid
You hurl the bubble of acid at a point you choose within range, and the bubble splatters there on impact.
Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Deterity Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `1d6` acid damage.
Objects within the spell's area that aren't being worn or carried also take this damage.

### Store Acid
You fill a *glass bottle* or similar container that you can touch with acid, yielding one 16-ounce *vial of acid*.
This item deals `1d6` acid damage instead of its normal damage amount.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the acid damage for either choice increases by `1d6` for each slot level.
