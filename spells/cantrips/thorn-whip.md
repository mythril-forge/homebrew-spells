## Description
You create a long, vine-like whip covered in thorns.
The thorned vine grows from your free hand, and lasts for the duration.
The vine has the same statistics as an ordinary *whip* with the following properties:
- The whip has a reach of 15 feet.
- If you hit a creature that is *large* or smaller with a Melee Weapon Attack using this whip, then you can pull it up to 15 feet closer to you.

This spell immediately ends if it is cast again before its duration expires, or if you let go of the whip.
The whip disappears once the spell ends.
