## Description
You seize an area of wind, which must fit within a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
You can command the air to create one of the following effects:
- You focus this spell on a creature within the spell's area, weaponizing the wind around it as you desire.
	The target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or take `1d4` bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (your choice).
- You focus this spell on a creature within the spell's area, attempting to blow them aside with a strong gust.
	The target must succeed on a Strength Saving Throw or be pushed 10 feet in a direction of your choice.
	The target must be *medium* or smaller, otherwise it automatically succeeds on this Saving Throw.
- You create some harmless sensory effect using the air—causing airy flourishes in your clothes, blasting doors open, or rustling foliage in the area.
	This effect lasts until the end of your next turn.
