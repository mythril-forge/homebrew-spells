## Description
You create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to a mile away.
Each creature within a 10-foot-radius aura eminating from you—including you—must make a Constitution Saving Throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes `1d12` thunder damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.
On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't pushed.

## At Higher Levels
When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the damage increases by `1d12` for each slot level.
