## Description
This spell allows you to activate or deactivate any device within range, as long it has a clearly defined on or off function—such as a button or switch—that is readily accessible from the outside of the device.
The function must be able to fit within a 5-foot-long cube originating from a point that you can see within range.
Any device that requires a software-based shutdown sequence to activate or deactivate cannot be affected by this spell.
